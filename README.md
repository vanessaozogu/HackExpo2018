# HackExpo2018

I built an image classifier model for the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/hackexpo2018">HackExpo2018<a/> competition aimed at telling the state of road traffic using Deep Learning. This model was built using the Fastai library that is based on Pytorch and I achieved a categorical accuracy of 0.96458 which was highest on the private leaderboard. The data can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/12020/download-all">here<a/>
